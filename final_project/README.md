## Project Idea 
Anxiety disorder results in mild to severe adverse behavioral effects in 31.1% of US adults at some point in their life. Researchers have linked anxiety to faster and shallower breathing. Respiration rate may thus be a good candidate for real-time anxiety monitoring and intervention. Various sensors like Bodybeat, Hexoskin, and a mask-based humidity sensor can measure breathing. However, some are uncomfortable to wear for an extended time, and others are currently priced out of consumersâ€™ budgets. 

This vision for a wearable respiration monitoring system takes the form of a pair of glasses with an integrated MEMS microphone placed near the hinge or bridge of the glasses. It interacts sends bluetooth data back to a phone that is running an app to detect

## Expected parts
The major components thus far include:
* a Teensy 4.1 Microcontroller which is compatible and programmable through 'Teensyduino' -- for collecting samples.  
* a Sparkfun MEMS Microphone Breakout Board -- for breath detection
* an Integrated Bluetooth Module -- for interfacing with our phone. 


## Interaction Plan

We expect wearers to treat the glasses and wear them as they normally would. 



Project Idea
Team
Rough form: this is your paper prototype (put photos on your GitHub, bring the actual thing to class)
Expected parts: is there a display, a motor, batters, interface, etc? Where does the Pi/Arduino/other controller go?
Interaction plan: how will people interact with your device?
